This repository contains a demonstration of an uncommon bug in Kotlin involving the `removeIf` function on a `MutableList`. The bug arises from the in-place modification of the list, leading to potential unexpected behavior if the list is being iterated or used in other operations concurrently. The solution demonstrates a safe way to handle the removal operation to prevent the bug.
